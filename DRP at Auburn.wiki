Are you an undergraduate student with a passion for delving into the captivating world of higher mathematics? Do you find joy in unraveling complex theorems, discovering elegant proofs, and exploring the boundless realms of mathematical concepts? If so, we have an exciting opportunity for you!

 

==Introducing the Directed Reading Program at Auburn University==

 

Our program is tailor-made for curious and motivated undergraduate students who aspire to deepen their understanding of advanced mathematical topics under the mentorship of experienced PhD mentors. This program is a unique avenue for you to enhance your mathematical prowess while building valuable relationships with experts in the field.

 

The purpose of this program is to provide the undergraduate students at Auburn the opportunity to work closely with a graduate student in the department of mathematics. Typically, an undergraduate student follows a textbook or a paper and the graduate student plays the role of a mentor. It is up to each pair to decide how frequently to meet and discuss the content, but once a week is usual. At the end of the semester, each student is encouraged to give a presentation (or write a report) about the project in order to solidify their own understanding and to pass it on to others. 

 

==Eligibility:==

 

Undergraduate students that have completed their calculus sequence and/or linear algebra are eligible. A solid foundation in fundamental mathematical concepts is essential, and a genuine enthusiasm for exploring higher-level mathematics is a must.

 

==Application Process:==

 

To apply for this enriching experience, submit your application by February 14 at the link at the bottom. Include your academic background, mathematical interests, and a brief statement on why you wish to participate in the program.

 

Don't miss this chance to embark on a journey of intellectual growth and discovery in the realm of higher mathematics. Expand your mathematical horizons, foster connections with experts, and fuel your passion for the abstract and profound.

 

This has been a very successful program for the past two years, and we are keeping up the momentum for it. Many past participants have gone on to great math PhD programs. If you are thinking of doing a graduate degree involving advanced mathematics, this program will help you develop crucial skills such as independent research, logical reasoning, and effective communication of complex ideas.
