Here are some theorems and results I should know. Of which I only need to know how to prove 2. These are starred for my ease of viewing. 

(*) A representation of a group G is the same thing as a \C [G] - module.
	Proof: Given a \C [G] modules, V, we have a linear action of G on a \C vector space. Thus giving a homomorphism from G to GL(V). This is our representation 
	
(*) The four key properties of tensor products: Commutativity, Associativity, compatibility with direct sums, and tensoring with the ring does nothing. 
	Proof:
	
Maschke's Theorem:

Cayley Hamilton Theorem

The invariant factors a_1, ... , a_m satisfy a_1 | ... | a_m

The characterstic plynomial is the product of the invaritn factors and hence also the product of thelemetnary divisors. 

Every matrix over a field F whose eigenvalues lie in F has a jordan canonical form

One can compute the invariant factors of an n x n matrix A, and hence its jordan canonical form, by finding the smith normal form of xI_n -A. I should be able to do this with my eyes closed.
