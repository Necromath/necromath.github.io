Here we deal with the the "avoid feverish tomato map"

Problem 1: Find smooth bijection $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ whose inverse is not smooth. Then add another condition to make $f^{-1}$ smooth and prove it.

Solution: Let $f(x)=x^3$. It has inverse $g(x)=x^{\frac{1}{3}}$. This does not have continuous derivative at $x=0$. So it is not smooth. If we add the condition that $f$ has nonzero derivative, then we can conclude that its inverse is smooth.

Problem 2:

Problem 3:

Problem 4: 

part a: If $\gamma_1 \sim \gamma_2$, then $d_pf(\gamma_1) \sim d_pf(\gamma_2)$. 

Solution: Let $(U, \varphi)$ be a chart on $M$ and let $p \in U$ such that $\gamma_i(0) = p , i=1,2$. Observe that $d_pf(\gamma_1'(0)) = (f \circ \gamma_1)'(0) = (f \circ\varphi ^{-1} \varphi \gamma_1)'(0) = d_p(f \circ \varphi^{-1})(0)(\varphi \circ \gamma_1)'(0) = d_p(f \circ \varphi^{-1})(0)(\varphi \circ \gamma_2)'(0) = (f \circ\varphi ^{-1} \varphi \gamma_2)'(0) = (f \circ \gamma_2)'(0) = d_pf(\gamma_2'(0))$
