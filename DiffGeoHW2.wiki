Here we deal with the the "avoid feverish tomato map"

Problem 1: Find smooth bijection $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ whose inverse is not smooth. Then add another condition to make $f^{-1}$ smooth and prove it.

Solution: Let $f(x)=x^3$. It has inverse $g(x)=x^{\frac{1}{3}}$. This does not have continuous derivative at $x=0$. So it is not smooth. If we add the condition that $f$ has nonzero derivative, then we can conclude that its inverse is smooth.

Problem 4: 

part a: If $\gamma_1 \sim \gamma_2$, then $d_pf(\gamma_1) \sim d_pf(\gamma_2)$. (Where $\gamma_1 \sim \gamma_2$ if for any chart $(U, \varphi)$ around $p \in M$, we have that $(\varphi \circ \gamma_1)'(0) = (\varphi \circ \gamma_2)'(0)$ ) 

Solution: Let $(U, \varphi)$ be a chart on $N$ and let $p \in U$ such that $\gamma_i(0) = p , i=1,2$. Observe that $(\varphi \circ (\f \circ \gamma_1))'(0) = \varphi(f \circ \gamma_1(0))(f \circ \gamma_1)'(0) = \varphi(f(p))(f \circ \gamma_1)'(0)$. Using the fact that $\gamma_1 \sim \gamma_2 \Rightarrow \gamma_1'(0) = \gamma_2'(0)$. It follows that $\varphi(f(p))(f \circ \gamma_1)'(0) = \varphi(f(p))f(\gamma_1(0))\gamma_1'(0) = \varphi(f(p))f(\gamma_2(0))\gamma_2'(0) = \varphi(f(p))(f \circ \gamma_2)'(0) = \varphi(f \circ \gamma_2(0))(f \circ \gamma_2)'(0) = (\varphi \circ (f \circ \gamma_2))'(0)$. Thus $d_pf(\gamma_1) \sim d_pf(\gamma_2)$ 

part b: Suppose $(U , \varphi)$ is a chart around $p$ with coordinate functions, $x^i$, and $\vec{v}$ is represented in those coordinates as $\vec{v} = v^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}$. If $(V, \psi)$ is a chart aroudn $f(p)$ with coordinate functions $y^j$, what is the representation of $d_pf(\vec{v})$ in the $y^j$ coordinates?

Solution:
