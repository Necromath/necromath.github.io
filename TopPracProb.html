Here are some topology exercises that I have done:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Define the cofinite topology \(\tau _{cof}\) on a set to be the collection of all sets \(U\) such that \(X \setminus U\) is finite, plus the empty set. Show this is a topology.
	Pf. First we observe that \(X\) is in our topology by remarking that \(X \setminus X = \varnothing\), the empty set is contained trivially in \(\tau\). So we just need to check that artbitary unions and finite intersections are in the topology.Observe that if \(U,V \in \tau\), then \( (X \setminus (U \cup V) \subseteq (X \subseteq U)\) is also finite. Induct on the number of sets. For finite intersections, if \(U \cap V = Z\), then \(X \setminus Z = (X \setminus U) \cup (X \setminnus V)\) which is still finite. Induct on your number of sets and you're done.

</ol>

<ol>
<li>
Let \((X,\tau)\) be a toplogical space, and let \(Y \subseteq X\). Then the following are equivalent: 
   (1) \(Y\) is closed.
   (2) \(Y\) contains all of its limit points
   (3) \(Y\) contains all of its boundary points. 

</ol>
<blockquote>
Pf. Assuming \(Y\) contains all its boundary points, then we see that that every limit point of \(Y\) is also contained in \(Y\). Since if \(x \in Y \) is a limit point but not a boundary point, then it is an interior (trivial) or an exterior point (not possible by defn of limit point). Thus, we must conclude that \(Y\) also contains all of its limit points. Since \(Y\) contains all of its limit points.
