=== Hi! ===

My name is Mauricio Montes and this is my website!
I am a second year graduate student in Mathematics at Auburn University
Here, I have written up some of my work (incorrect in some parts) for others to use for reference and understanding.


This is an [[art gallery]]

And this is not a pipe

Hello Dr. Chen!!

Note to self: git push and then inserting the proper credentials allowed us to use lazygit push without having to use authorization. But then the program reverted back to asking for credentials again.

$\int_0^1 x^2 dx $

This is a new note to show off to my friends and family during thanksgiving!
