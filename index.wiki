=== Welcome! ===

My name is Mauricio Montes and this is my website!
I earned my Bachelors in Mathematics (2021) from UT Austin (Hook 'em) and am 
a fourth year PhD student in Mathematics at Auburn University

I am primarily interested in applications of algebraic topology, sheaves, and signal processing.

Some of [[Research| my work]] that I have done. 

Here, I have written up some of my work (please read it with a critical eye, not everything is a detailed proof) for others to use for reference and understanding.
I have worked out some [[random solutions to stuff | textbook solutions]]in my past and have them here.

$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{cos(x)}{1+x^2} = \frac{\pi}{e}$
