=== Mauricio Montes === 

I earned my Bachelors in Mathematics (2021) from UT Austin (Hook 'em) and am 
a fourth year PhD student in Mathematics at Auburn University

I am interested in applications of algebraic topology, category theory,
topological signal processing, and laplacians with a focus on chemical reaction networks.

Some of [[Research| my work]] that I have done.

$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{cos(x)}{1+x^2} = \frac{\pi}{e}$
