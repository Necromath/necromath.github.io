=== Hi! ===

My name is Mauricio Montes and this is my website!
I am a second year graduate student in Mathematics at Auburn University
Here, I have written up some of my work (please read it with a critical eye, not everything is a detailed proof) for others to use for reference and understanding.

My [[solutions to Folland]]  Real Analysis

My solutions to questions in my [[Differential Geometry]] class

My solutions to questions in [[commutative algebra]] class following Atiyah-Mcdonald

My solutions to questions in [[homological algebra]] class following Weibel

My solutions to questions in my [[probability]] class following Billingsley

Some personal [[Miscellaneous Work]]

$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{cos(x)}{1+x^2} = \frac{\pi}{e}$
