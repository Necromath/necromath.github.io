<p>
Here are some theorems and results I should know. Of which I only need to know how to prove 2. These are starred for my ease of viewing. 
</p>

<p>
(*) A representation of a group G is the same thing as a \C [G] - module.
	Proof: Let G be a group, \rho its representation in GL(V). 
</p>
	
<p>
(*) The four key properties of tensor products: Commutativity, Associativity, compatibility with direct sums, and tensoring with the ring does nothing. 
	Proof:
</p>
	
<p>
Maschke's Theorem:
</p>

<p>
Cayley Hamilton Theorem
</p>

<p>
The invariant factors a_1, ... , a_m satisfy a_1 | ... | a_m
</p>

<p>
The characterstic plynomial is the product of the invaritn factors and hence also the product of thelemetnary divisors. 
</p>

<p>
Every matrix over a field F whose eigenvalues lie in F has a jordan canonical form
</p>

<p>
One can compute the invariant factors of an n x n matrix A, and hence its jordan canonical form, by finding the smith normal form of xI_n -A. I should be able to do this with my eyes closed.
