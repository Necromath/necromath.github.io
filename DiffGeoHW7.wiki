This is for HW 7, oh comedy hologram

Question 1: Line integrals of vector fields

Answer: 

Part A: If $X$ is the gradient of a function, applying stokes theorem to the form $X_x \cdot v$ when
integrating along the path $\gamma$ will cause the integral to be 0.

If $X$ is conservative, this means that it is exact (recall Ian's Talk), hence there is a function
$f$ whose derivative is exactly $X_{\gamma(t)} \cdot \gamma'(t) dt$

Part B: If $X$ is conservative on this star shaped subset $U$, then from our calc 3 knowledge, we
know that the curl of the gradient of a function is equal to 0.

Now, if the curl of $X$ is equal to 0, then this means that $X$ was the gradient of some function
$f$, hence, it is conservative. 

Question 2: First cohomology of the torus

Answer: If $w$ is exact, then there is some $\eta$ such that $w = d \eta$. But 
then 

$\int_{\gamma_j} (d \eta)  = \int_a ^b d(d \eta) = 0 $

Conversely, if $\int_{\gamma_j} w = 0$m then 

Question 3: Cup Products

Answer: This amounts to showing that the wedge of exact and closed is exact, wedge of closed and closed is
closed 

Question 4: More punctures

Answer: Puncture and retract.

Question 5: Poincare Duality Part 1
