<div id="Exercise 1.2.5"><h1 id="Exercise 1.2.5" class="header"><a href="#Exercise 1.2.5">Exercise 1.2.5</a></h1></div>

<p>
Prove that \(Tot(C)\) is acyclic if the double complex is bounded and the rows and columns are exact.
</p>

<div id="Solution:"><h1 id="Solution:" class="header"><a href="#Solution:">Solution:</a></h1></div>

<p>
Let \(C\) be a bounded double complex with exact rows and columns and consider \(x=(x_{p,q}) \in Tot(C)_n\), where \(p+q = n\) for any integers \(p,q\).
</p>


<p>
Recall that \(d(x_{p,q}) = d^h(x_{p,q}) + d^v(x_{p,q})\). Since \(C\) is bounded, we can look at the north eastern most nontrivial module \(C_{i,j}\) and hence nontrivial \(Tot(C)_k\).
</p>

<p>
The procedure is as follow: Start with \(d(x_{p,q}) = d^h(x_{p,q}) + d^v(x_{p,q})\), note that if \(x_{p,q}\) lies in the kernel of \(d\), then there exists an element \(x_{p-1,q+1}\) such that \(d^h(x_{p-1,q+1}) = 0\). Exactness of our columns then tells us that \(x_{p-1,q+1}=d^v(x_{p-1,q+2})\). An identical argument can be made for the rows. Combining these facts together we see that every element in \(Ker(d_{n})\) comes from an element in \(Im(d_{n-1}\). Hence \(Im(d_{n-1}) = Ker(d_n)\)
</p>

<p>
Thus \(Tot(C)\) is acyclic.
</p>

<p>
Exercise 1.3.1
</p>

<p>
Let \(0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0\) be a short exact sequence of complexes. Show that if two of the three complexes A,B,C are exact, then so is the third.
</p>

<p>
Solution: First, let \(B,C\) be exact complexes. Then, their homologies are 0 everywhere. So we can look at instead the short exact sequence \(0 \to H_n(A) \to 0 \to 0 \to 0\). Wherein exactness tells us immediately that \(H_n(A)\) is trivial, hence \(A\) is exact. 
</p>

<p>
This argument can be repeated for \(A,C\) and \(A,B\). So we're done.

This one will be turned in by hand, it's better with the diagram and I can't use tikz in this environment.

<div id="Exercise 1.3.5:"><h1 id="Exercise 1.3.5:" class="header"><a href="#Exercise 1.3.5:">Exercise 1.3.5:</a></h1></div>

<p>
Let \(f\) be a morphism of chain complexes. Show that if \(ker(f)\) and \(coker(f)\) are acyclic, then \(f\) is a quasi-isomorphism. Is the converse true?
</p>

<div id="Solution:"><h1 id="Solution:" class="header"><a href="#Solution:">Solution:</a></h1></div>

<p>
Let \(A,B\) be chain complexes and \(f: A \to B\) a morphism. We will show that if \(ker(f)\) and \(coker(f)\) are acyclic, then \(f\) is a quasi-isomorphism.
</p>

<p>
Notice that we get a short exact sequence \(0 \to ker(f) \to A \to Im(f) \to 0\) and \(0 \to Im(f) \to B \to coker(f) \to 0\). If we look at the long exact sequence of homology that is induced from the first part. It looks like \(0 \to 0 \to H_n(A) \to H_n(Im(f)) \to 0\) since both \(ker(f)\) and \(Im(f)\) are acyclic. Exactness of this sequence tells us that \(H_n(A) \cong H_n(Im(f))\). We can make the exact same argument for the other short exact sequence and the induced long exact sequence on homology for that. Which means we get \(H_n(A) \cong H_n(Im(f)) \cong H_(B)\). Thus \(f\) is a quasi-isomorphism from A to B. 
</p>

<p>
The converse is not true. This is show by the following example: Let \(A\) be the chain complex \(\ldots \to 0 \to 0 \to \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \to 0 \to \ldots\) and \(B\) the chain complex \(\ldots \to 0 \to \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \to 0 \to 0\to \ldots \) where only the middle \(\mathbb{Z}\) terms coincide, everywhere else 0. 
</p>

<p>
If we let \(f\) be the chain complex morphism \(f: A \to B\) that sends the middle \(\mathbb{Z}\) to the middle \(\mathbb{Z}\) and everywhere else 0, then \(ker(f)\) and \(coker(f)\) are not acyclic. But \(f\) is a quasi-isomorphism. Since the Homologies of \(ker(f)\) and \(coker(f)\) are nontrivial at exactly one place.

<div id="1."><h1 id="1." class="header"><a href="#1.">1.</a></h1></div>

<p>
Let \(A.\) be an acyclic bounded below chain complex of free R-modules. 
</p>

<p>
The complex is exact, since it is acyclic.
</p>

<p>
Since \(A_n\) is a free module, we can decompose its basis into a direct sum \(A_n =  Z_n \oplus B'_n \) where \(Z_n\) is the kernel of the chain map \(d_n\) and \(B'_n = A_n \ Z_n\). Since the complex is exact, we have that \(Z_n = d(C_n) = B'_{n+1}\). So we can choose a basis in \(B'_{n+1}\) and let \(s_n:C_n \to C_{n+1}\) be s_n(z_i) = j_k where \(z_i\) is an element of the basis for \(Z_n\) and \(j_k\) is a fixed choice of basis element of \(B'_{n+1}\) and \(s_n(0) = 0\).
</p>

<p>
We can utilize the observation that \(d_{n+1}\) is surjective onto its image which is exactly \(Z_n\). Thus making \(Z_n\) projective over itself and the surjection ypyy
</p>

<p>
It is clear then that this is a splitting of \(A_n\). Hence, \(A.\) is split exact.
