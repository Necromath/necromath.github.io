This is the exercsies from Chapter 2 of Atiyah-Mcdonald

Exercise 9: Given an exact sequence of A-modules, $0 \rightarrow M' \rightarrow M \rightarrow M'' \rightarrow 0$ where A is a ring. If $M', M''$ are finitely generated. Then so is $M$.

Solution: Let's call the first map $f, f:M' \rightarrow M$ and the second map $g, g: M \rightarrow M''$. Consider the set, $\{x_n\}$ of generators of $M''$ and $\{y_n\}$ of $M'$. If we consider the submodule, $N$, of $M$ generated by $\{g^{-1}(x_n)\}$ and $\{f(y_n)\}$, the image of $N$ under $g$ is exactly $M''$ and it has kernel $f(M')$. But this is exactly $M$. So we are done.

Exericse 10: Let $A$ be a ring, $r$ an ideal contained in the Jacobson radical of $A$. Let $M$ be an $A$-module and $N$ a finitely generated $A$-module, and let $u: M \rightarrow N$ be a homomorphism. If the induced homomorphism $M/rM \rightarrow N/rN$ is surjective. Then $u$ is surjective.

Solution: We get the induced homomorphism $M \rightarrow M / rM \rightarrow N /rN$. Which implies the fact that $u(M) + rN = N$. Note that $N$ is finitely generated and $r \subseteq J(A)$. From our corrolary to Nakayama's Lemma. We can conclude that $u(M) = N$. Hence, $u$ is surjective.  

Exercise 11: To be done at a later date...
