There was a discussion today (3/31/2021) about: Given Normed Vector Spaces X,Y. 
Given a transformation T \in L(X,Y) that is continuous. Then T is closed. 

Gabe: 

Fix (x,y) \notin \Gamma(T) where T:X\rightarrow Y is continuous. [insert topological
approach]

Monday:

[analytical version, just observe that the limit of
(x_n,Tx_n)-> (x,Tx) = (x_n,Tx_n)-> (x,y) ]
