Here are my written solutions to Chapter 5 of Folland:

[[Functional Analysis Notes]]

Exercise 1: If $X$ is a normed vector space over $K (= \mathbb{R} \textrm{or} \mathbb{C} )$, then addition and multiplication are continuous from $X \times X$ and $K \times X$ to $X$. Moreover, the norm is continuous from $X$ to $[0,\infty)$; in fact, $\|x\|-\|y\| \leq \|x-y\|$. 

Proof:
To prove continuity of addition we use a $\delta - \epsilon $ proof. Let $x,x_0,y,y_0 \in X$ be such that $\|(x,y)-(x_0,y_0)\|=\|((x-x_0,y-y_0))\| < \delta = \frac{\epsilon}{2}.$ From the definition of product norm, this is simply $\textrm{max}(\|(x-x_0)\|,\|(y-y_0)\|).$ Then we see that under the map $+:X\times X \rightarrow X$ we have that 

$\|(x+y)-(x_0+y_0)\| = \|(x-x_0) + (y-y_0)\| \leq \|x-x_0\| + \|y-y_0\| < \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon .$ 

Thus, addition is continuous in $X$. 

Next we prove continuity of multiplication. Let $\lambda$ be an element of our field $K$ and let $x$ be an element of $X$. The goal is to show that if $\|(\lambda,x)-(\psi,x_0)\| < \delta.$ Then $\|\lambda x - \psi x_0 \| < \epsilon $. Usually whenever I try to work out these sorts of inequalities, I never really see it until I see a cheesed out answer. So here is the cheesed out answer. Consider $\| \lambda x - \psi x_0 \| = \|\lambda x -\lambda x_0 + \lambda x_0 - \psi x_0\| \leq \| \lambda x -\lambda x_0 \| + \| \lambda x_0 - \psi x_0 \| = |\lambda| \|x-x_0\|+ |\lambda - \psi| \|x_0\|$. 

What should one do in this situation? Why simply set $\delta = \textrm{min} (1, \frac{\epsilon}{3\|x\|}, \frac{\epsilon}{3|\lambda|}, \frac{\epsilon}{3} ) $ Then we know that $|\lambda - \psi| < 1$. So then $|\lambda| \|x-x_0\|+ |\lambda - \psi| \|x_0\| \leq |\lambda - \psi| \|x\| + |\psi| \|x-x_0\| + |\lambda - \psi | \|x-x_0\| < \frac{\epsilon}{3} + \frac{\epsilon}{3} + \frac{\espilon}{3} < \epsilon$. Thus, multiplication is continuous. 

Now we show that the norm operation is continuous: To show that the norm $\| \bullet \| : X \rightarrow [0,\infty)$ is continuous. 

First we observe that $\| x + y \| \leq \|x\| + \|y\|$
