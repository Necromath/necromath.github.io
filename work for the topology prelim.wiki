Here is where I would put my work for topology...

If I had any!! (Dinkleberg to blame)

Here are definitions to know: [[DefinTop]]

Here are some problems I have practiced: [[TopPracProb]]

Here are some very important theorems to know the proof of: [[ImpTopThm]]

Some thoughts: A lot of the questions in old prelims see to cover a couple of themes from point set topology. Connectedness, Compactness, Hausdorff, Normal, Metric, Products of spaces, continuous functions. 

From algebraic topology: Universal covering space, retraction, homomorphism of fundamental groups.
