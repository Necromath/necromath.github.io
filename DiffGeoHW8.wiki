This is for HW 8, my main regeneration

Question 1: Round Metric

This was shown in Lee's Riemannian Manifolds: An Introduction to Curvature. Lemma 3.4

Question 2: Euclidean geodesics



Question 3: Complete metrics on $\mathbb{R}$

We show the following for the positive case, the negative integral case is very similar. If this space is complete, then every cauchy sequence converges. Then, consider the Cauchy sequence
$t_1,t_2,\ldots$ so that then $\int_0 ^\infty \sqrt{f(t)}dt = \sum_i=0 ^{\infty}\int_{t_i}^{t_{i+1}}$

Since the sequence is Cauchy, it converges to a limit that exists, say $\bar{x}$. Then 

Question 4: Symmetric connections

Here we chase down some definitions. Let $X = X^i \partial_i$, and $Y = Y^j \partial^j$. So then we
see that $\nabla_X Y - \nabla_Y X - [X,Y] = X^i(Y^j \Gamma_{ij}^k \partial_k + Y_i ^j + \partial_j)- Y^j(X^i \Gamma_{ji}^k \partial_k + X^{i}_{j} \partial_i) - (X^i Y^j_i -Y^i X^j_i)\partial_J$

Question 5: Space connections
