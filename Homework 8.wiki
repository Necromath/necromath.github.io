This is my work and thoughts for homework 8 for algebra:

Q1. Let $m,n$ be relatively prime integers. Then $(\mathbb{Z} / m\mathbb{Z} ) \otimes (\mathbb{Z} / n\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ 
	Proof: Since $m,n$ and relatively prime. Then there exists integers $p,q$ such that $mp +nq = 1$. Then, for any element $(x\otimes y) \in (\mathbb{Z} / m\mathbb{Z}) \otimes (\mathbb{Z} / n\mathbb{Z}) $ we have that: 
	
	$x \otimes y = 1 (x \otimes y) = (mp+nq)(x \otimes y) = mp(x \otimes y) + nq (x \otimes y) = (mpx \otimes y) + (x \otimes nqy) = (0 \otimes y) + (x \otimes 0) = 0 $
	
Q2.
