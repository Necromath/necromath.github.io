7.1: 

Gambler with initial capital $a$ plays until his fortune increases $b$ units or he is ruined. Recall
that $\rho = \frac{q}{p} > 1$, where $p$ is the probability of success and $q$ is the probability of
failure. Suppose that the chance of success is multiplied by $1+\theta$ if his initial capital is
infinite instead of $a$. Show that $0 < \theta < (\rho ^{a} -1)^{-1} < (a(\rho -1))^{-1}$

Solution: Recall that the probability of of success with initial capital is given by 
$S= \frac{\rho^a -1}{\rho^{a+b}-1} \leq\ \rho^{-b}$ where the inequality follows from the probability of success
with infinite capital. Then, adapting what we have from the problem itself:

$S= \frac{\rho^a -1}{\rho^{a+b}-1} (1+\theta)=  \rho^{-b}$, then solve for $\theta$

This yields that $\theta = \frac{1-\rho^{-b}}{\rho^{a}-1} < \frac{1}{\rho^a -1}$

Note that since $\rho >1$, we have that $a(\rho -1) < \rho^a -1$ and thus
$\frac{1}{\rho^a -1} < \frac{1}{a(\rho -1)}$
Hence, $\theta < \frac{1}{a(\rho -1)}$

Gamblers Ruin/Fortune deduced from SLoLN: $\begin{equation} P( \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = p-q) = 1\end{equation}$, where
$p-q \neq 0$. Try bounding things. Look at your phone pictures.

8.2:

Dr. Chen thought this was a good problem (cough) 

8.3:

Take a random walk and send to {-1,0,1} determined if the value at the walk was positive, negative,
or 0

8.15:

Good problem according to Le
