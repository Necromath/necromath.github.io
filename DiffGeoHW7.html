This is for HW 7, oh comedy hologram
</p>

<p>
Question 1: Line integrals of vector fields
</p>

<p>
Answer: 
</p>

<p>
Part A: If \(X\) is the gradient of a function, applying stokes theorem to the form \(X_x \cdot v\) when
integrating along the path \(\gamma\) will cause the integral to be 0.
</p>

<p>
If \(X\) is conservative, this means that it is exact (recall Ian's Talk), hence there is a function
\(f\) whose derivative is exactly \(X_{\gamma(t)} \cdot \gamma'(t) dt\)
</p>

<p>
Part B: If \(X\) is conservative on this star shaped subset \(U\), then from our calc 3 knowledge, we
know that the curl of the gradient of a function is equal to 0.
</p>

<p>
Now, if the curl of \(X\) is equal to 0, then this means that \(X\) was the gradient of some function
\(f\), hence, it is conservative. 
</p>

<p>
Question 2: First cohomology of the torus
</p>

<p>
Answer: If \(w\) is exact, then there is some \(\eta\) such that \(w = d \eta\). But 
then 
</p>

<p>
\(\int_{\gamma_j} (d \eta)  = \int_a ^b d(d \eta) = 0 \)
</p>

<p>
Conversely, if \(\int_{\gamma_j} w = 0\)m then 
</p>

<p>
Question 3: Cup Products
</p>

<p>
Answer: This amounts to showing that the wedge of exact and closed is exact, wedge of closed and closed is
closed 
</p>

<p>
Question 4: More punctures
</p>

<p>
Answer: Puncture and retract.
</p>

<p>
Question 5: Poincare Duality Part 1
