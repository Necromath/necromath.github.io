Update from April 22, 2022: I got an 86 on that exam. Not bad given that I didn't do /everything/. However, the prelim requires me to know more. So we need to go all the way back. Dr. Brown mentioned not looking at past prelims and rather  emphasized our coursework more. I'm not sure if starting linearly is something desriable or efficient, but I sense it guarantees a pass on the prelim.
