7.1: 
</p>

<p>
Gambler with initial capital \(a\) plays until his fortune increases \(b\) units or he is ruined. Recall
that \(\rho = \frac{q}{p} &gt; 1\), where \(p\) is the probability of success and \(q\) is the probability of
failure. Suppose that the chance of success is multiplied by \(1+\theta\) if his initial capital is
infinite instead of \(a\). Show that \(0 &lt; \theta &lt; (\rho ^{a} -1)^{-1} &lt; (a(\rho -1))^{-1}\)
</p>

<p>
Solution: Recall that the probability of of success with initial capital is given by 
\(S= \frac{\rho^a -1}{\rho^{a+b}-1} \leq\ rho^{-b}\) where the inequality follows from the probability of success
with infinite capital. Then, adapting what we have from the problem itself:
</p>

<p>
\(S= \frac{\rho^a -1}{\rho^{a+b}-1} \leq\ rho^{-b} (1+ \theta) = \rho^{-b}\), then solve for \(\theta\)

<p>
Gamblers Ruin/Fortune deduced from SLoLN: \(P( lim \frac{1}{n} \Sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = p-q) =1\), where
\(p-q \neq 0\). Try bounding things. Look at your phone pictures.

<p>
Dr. Chen this was a good problem (cough) 
</p>

<p>
8.3:
</p>

<p>
Take a random walk and send to {-1,0,1} determined if the value at the walk was positive, negative,
or 0

<p>
Good problem according to Le
