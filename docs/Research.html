I am currently working on developing a theory of sheaves for chemical reaction networks,
I would love to talk about this with anyone that is interested. Here below, I have some of my
research projects that I have been involved in:

Random Deposition of Tetris Pieces and their Topology:

<p>
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/tetris-ballistic/">Tetris Random Deposition</a>
</p>

<p>
This Python package offers a suite of tools designed for simulating various random surface growth models. The foundational concepts and methodologies are significantly influenced by the work presented in the book by Barab√°si and Stanley [BarabasiS95] (1995) on fractal concepts in surface growth.
</p>

<p>
It is known that the fluctuations in the surface growth models fall into a few universality classes. The most famous one is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation Kardar et al. [KPZ86]
</p>

<p>
\(\frac{\partial h(t,x)}{\partial t} = \nu \nabla^2 h(t,x) + \frac{\lambda}{2}((\nabla h(t,x))^2 + \eta(t,x), \text{ } t&gt;0, x \in \mathbb{R},\)
</p>

<p>
Where \(\eta\) is a centered Gaussian noise, which is white in both space and time. The KPZ equation is a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE)
