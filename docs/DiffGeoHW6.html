This is for HW 6, Eerily Hot.
</p>

<p>
Question 1: Jacobi's Formula [Done need to type up]
</p>

<p>
Answer:
Part A: First observe 
\( \textrm{det}(I_N +tA) = 1 +t \textrm{tr}(A) + \textrm{(Higher order t terms)}\)
</p>

<p>
Then differentiating with respect to \(t\) at \(t=0\)
</p>

<p>
\( \frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0} \textrm{det}(I_N +tA) = 0 +\textrm{tr}(A) + \frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0}\textrm{(Higherorder t terms)}\)
</p>

<p>
The higher order \(t\) terms vanish here since we are evaluating at \(t=0\). Leaving us with 
</p>

<p>
\(\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0}\textrm{det}(I_n+tA) = \textrm{tr}(A)\)
</p>

<p>
Part B: Observe that 
</p>

<p>
\(\begin{split} \frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0}[\textrm{det}(X+tB)]&amp;=\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=1}[\textrm{det}(X)\textrm{det}(I_n+tX^{-1}B)]\\ &amp; =\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0}\textrm{det}(I_n+tX^{-1}B) \times \textrm{det}(X) + 0 \\ &amp;= \textrm{tr}(X^{-1}B)\times \textrm{det}(X) \end{split} \)
</p>

<p>
Question 2: Hopf Fibrations
</p>

<p>
Answer: We first show smoothness, which is equivalent to showing that the circle is bijective.
</p>

<p>
Observe that the group action \(\Theta: S^1 \times S^{2n-1} \rightarrow S^{2n-1}\) is given by
\(\Theta_z(w) = zw\), so \(\Theta_{z^{-1}}(zw) = z^{-1}zw= (z^{-1}zw^i) = w\)
</p>

<p>
Where this multiplication is smooth on each coordinate \(w^i\)
</p>

<p>
For \(w \in S^{2n-1}\), the orbit \(S^1 \cdot w = \{z\cdot w | z\in S^1\}\) should rotate each coordinate by a whole circle
</p>

<p>
If we then look at the \((2n+1)\) sphere as a subset of \(\mathbb{C}^{n+1}\), we see that the map 
</p>

<p>
\(F:S^1 (\subset \mathbb{C}) \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^{n+1} \) by \(F(z) = (zw^1, \ldots, zw^{n+1})\)
</p>

<p>
This is a linear map and is injective, so then the image is exactly a circle. 
</p>

<p>
Injectivity then tells us that this map partitions the sphere into disjoint circles, so then the
union of all of these circles should be \(S^{2n+1}\)
</p>

<p>
Question 3: Quaternionic Sphere 
</p>

<p>
Answer:
</p>

<p>
Part A: Observe that \(p*p = (\bar{a},-b)(a,b) = (\bar{a}a +b\bar{b}, ab-ab) = (|a|^2 +|b|^2, 0)\)
</p>

<p>
So \(S \subset \mathbb{H}*\), where \(S = \{ p \in \mathbb{H} | |p| =1 \}\)
</p>

<p>
So \(S\) is a subgroup of \(\mathbb{H}*\) since for any \(p,q \in S\), we get that \(|pq| = |p||q| =1\)
</p>

<p>
The fact that \(S\) has manifold structure follows from Lee 20.12
</p>

<p>
Now we want to show that \(S \cong SU(2)\)
</p>

<p>
The isomorphism from \(SU(2)\) to \(S\) follows from the determinant map. Where \(det(A) = |p|^2 + |q|^2= aa*\)
</p>

<p>
Where \(a=(p,q) \in \mathbb{H}*\)
</p>

<p>
Part B: Let \(q=(a,b)\in S\), then \(qi = (ai,bi), qj=(-\bar{b},\bar{a}) , qk =(\bar{b}i,-\bar{a}i)\).
</p>

<p>
Taking the dot product with each other gives 0, hence this is linearly independent and all
three together form a frame for \(S\). Left invariance follows from the fact that adding a left shift
corresponds to a left shift in each coordinate in the frame. i.e. \(L_x(qi) = (q+x)i = qi +xi \) which
is a frame for \(q+x\)
</p>


<p>
Question 4: Abelian Exponentials
</p>

<p>
Answer: Here I am referring to Lee 8.40
</p>

<p>
We have that the Lie Algebra for \(\mathbb{R}^n\) is itself and for the torus it is also
\(\mathbb{R}^n\). The exponential map \(exp: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n\) is the integral
curve of a constant vector field pointing in the direction of a point \(x\in \mathbb{R}^n\)
</p>

<p>
In the case of the Torus, we can think of it as \(\mathbb{R}^n\)quotiented by the basis vector in each
direction 
with appropriate gluings. So we can then just interpret the exponential map of the torus as the 
quotient of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) to the torus after applying the exponential map at the origin in \(\mathbb{R}^n\). 
In other words, I apply Proposition 20.8 (g) with the observation that \(\Phi\) is the quotient map.
So then the \(exp\) map of \(T^n\) is really just quotienting after applying the exponential map
</p>


<p>
Question 5: Lee 20-6
</p>

<p>
Part A:Since \(A= e^B\), we can set \(C = e^\frac{B}{2}\). Then \(C^2 = e^B = A\)
</p>

<p>
Part B: Recall that \(A= \begin{pmatrix} \frac{-1}{2} &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -2 \end{pmatrix}\) 
</p>

<p>
If \(A \in Gl(n,\mathbb{R})\) was in the image, then there would exist a \(C\) such that when squared, is 
</p>

<p>
\(\begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d \end{pmatrix} ^2 = \begin{pmatrix} a^2+bc &amp; b(a+d) \\ c(a+d) &amp; bc+d^2 \end{pmatrix} \)
</p>

<p>
But this then forces either \(b\) or \(c\) is 0 which is a contradiction, or \(a =-d\) which is a
contradiction too.
</p>

<p>
Question 6: Commuting Exponentials 
Answer:
</p>

<p>
Part A: If \([X,Y] =0\), then as vector fields, \(X\) and \(Y\) commute with their flows.
</p>

<p>
Part B: If \(G\) is Abelian, then the previous proposition immediately implies that \(\frak{g}\) is
Abelian too. Since \(exp(tX)exp(sY) \in G\)
</p>

<p>
If \(\frak{g}\) commutes, then at any point \(p \in G\), if it were to be acted upon by the flow
corresponding to a left shift, \(L_q, q\in G\), this corresponds to \(p+q\), but by commutivity of the
flows, if we had \(q\) acted upon by the left shift \(L_p\), we get \(q+p\). So then since \([L_q,L_p]=0\)
moving by q at p is the same as moving by p at q. Hence, these elements commute.(This is how I am
thinking about the problem, not very formal. I'm trying to find the math to put to the words)
