For the longest time since my family moved back to the US in 2012. I wanted to visit California. It
was sold to me as the larger-than-life mythical place. Where the beaches are gorgeous, people
are kind, delicious food, and the weather is perfect. I wanted to experience it all. The opportunity
came during March. I received an email telling me that I was accepted to the SLMath (formerly MSRI)
summer school in TDA (My research interest!) and Machine Learning. I don't know if I actually did
cry when I read it, but I was certainly overjoyed. It's nice to be wanted for something, after all.

I arrived a day early to the summer school. I had unwittingly booked my flight a day too early and
needed to find somewhere to stay. I ended up at a hostel right at the shore in Pacific Beach. It was
quite an enjoyable day. The people were friendly and I had a nice time chatting to everyone.

The next day, I made it to UCSD and settled in until the next day. What ensued was 2 weeks of
listening to lectures, looking up and reading papers, and talking to other graduate students in math
with similar interests to me. It was quite nice to be able to talk to people who were young and
excited in a field that is related to what you do. As of my current writing of this, I have some
irons in the fire from my discussions with the people that I have met there. A big thank you to
everyone that I met at UCSD. It was a revitalizing moment that encouraged me to keep going.

At the end of the conference, I travelled with my friend Kellen from undergrad (hook 'em!) up
through California. We rented a car and moved to LA, staying there for a few days, and then San
Francisco. Los Angeles is a surreal city, as was San Francisco. I don't think California was too far
from what I expected. But I know that I want to come back. I'll have to write down my feelings
later.

Sabrina was in LA during the time that I was in town too. My message to her: I am proud of you Sabrina! Congratulations
for making it to the SLAC. I am so grateful that you have proven me wrong. I only said those mean
things because I didn't have a way to end things honestly. I think you probably knew that. But I am
glad that you are much more successful than me. I would have never been able to live myself
otherwise. As we slip from each others minds, I selfishly hope that you never forget about me. I
have flagellated myself more times than I can count over my actions. However, I know that the
temperance it has instilled in me has been more beneficial than if I was the same person. Then
again, it is not the job of women to fix men until they run into their future wife. I apologize for
perpetuating the cycle. This calls into question. Who is this paragraph for? For me? For her? How
many times can one hash and rehash the same topic over? Is there a benefit? Chewing the cud of
regret and of your past actions gives some direction. I think constantly reevaluating my past
actions has been helpful. I encounter different perspectives on the same situation, the only
difference is my age when I thought it. So I hope I have developed some more maturity. It does kind
of depress me when I realize that I am much more serious than I am from before. I don't feel
particularly light or at ease about things. Oftentimes, I feel jaded towards the world. I think I am
just unhappy with myself. Things are hard
