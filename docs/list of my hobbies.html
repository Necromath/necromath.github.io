I like to cook! We (are supposed to) eat every day. So why not enjoy the food that we eat? Cooking is lots of fun to me since I get to experiment with different flavors and textures. I always see cooking as a mini project whose rewards I reap not even a few moments later. I come from a Mexican cuisine, but I really like Chinese(Szechuan), Korean, and southeast Asian cuisines for their spices.

I also like to play tennis! I'm somewhere around a 7.5 UTR and I really like to play doubles, lefty spin always comes in clutch for those high bouncing serves on to righty back hands.
