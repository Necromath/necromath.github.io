Here are some definitions to know:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Topology: A topology \(\tau\) on a set \(X\) is a collection of subsets of \(X\), called open subsets, denoted \(U\), such that: \(X \in \tau\) and arbitrary unions and finite intersections \(\cup U\) and \(\cap _{i=1} ^{n} U\) are subsets of \(\tau\) 

<li>
If \(x \in N \subseteq X\) then we say that \(N\) is a neighborhood of \(x\) if there is an open set \(U\) with \(x\in U \subseteq N\)

<li>
If \(Y \subseteq X\) and \(x\in X\), then \(x\) is called a limit point of \(Y\) if every neighborhoood of \(x\) intersects \(Y\) in a point distinct from \(x\). 

</ol>
   
<ol>
<li>
A point \(x \in X\) is called an interior point of the set \(Y\) if there is a neighborhood of \(x\) which is contained in \(Y\). We say that \(x\) is an exterior point of the set \(Y\) if there is a neighborhood \(N\) of \(x\) which is disjoint from \(Y\).

<li>
A point \(x \in X\) is called a boundary point of \(Y\) if and only if every neighborhood of \(x\) intersects both \(Y\) and \(X \setminus Y\). 

<li>
A topological space \(X\) is called connected if there does not exist open sets \(U,V \subseteq X\) such that \(U \cap V = \empty \) and \(U \cup V = X \). 

</ol>
   
<ol>
<li>
A topological space \(X\) is called compact if every open cover of \(X\) has a finite subcover.

<li>
A map \(p:E \rightarrow B \) is a covering map if for all \(b \in B\), there exists open \(U_b \subseteq B\) such that \(b \in U_b\) and \(p^-1 (U_b) = \cup_{i=1}V_i\). Where each \(V_i \subseteq E \) is open and \(\{V_i : i\in I \}\) is disjoint with \(p|_{V_i} : V_i \rightarrow U_b \) is a homeomorphism. If \(E\) is simply connected, then we call \(E\) a universal covering space of \(B\) and we refer to \(p\) as a universal covering map. 

<li>
If \(f: [0,1] \rightarrow B, f(0) =b_0, p(e_0)=b_0\), then there is a unique "lift" \( \tilde{f} : [0,1] \rightarrow E\), and \(\tilde{f}(0) = e_0, p \circ \tilde{f} = f\). This is the same for homotopies, \(H:[0,1]^2 \rightarrow B\)

<li>
If \(\tilde{f},\tilde{g}: [0,1] \rightarrow E, \tilde{f}(1)=\tilde{g}(0)\). Then \( p \circ (\tilde{f} \star \tilde{g}) = (p \circ \tilde{f}) \star (p \circ \tilde{g})\).

<li>
If \(p : \rightarrow B\) is a universal covering map and \(f,g: [0,1] \rightarrow B, f(0)=g(0) = b_0\), then \(f \simeq_p g\) if and only if \(\tilde{f}(1) = \tilde{g}(1)\) where \(\tilde{f},\tilde{g}\) are lifts with \(\tilde{f}(0) = \tilde{g}(0)=e_0 \in p^{-1}(b_0)\)

<li>
Given a covering map \(p:E \rightarrow B\), a deck transformation is a homeomorphism \(h: E \rightarrow E \) such that \(p= p \circ h\) 

</ol>
<pre><code>
</pre></code>
<ol>
<li>
\(\pi_1(B,b_0)\) is isomorphic to the group of deck transformations.
