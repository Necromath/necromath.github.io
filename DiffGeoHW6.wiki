This is for HW 6, Eerily Hot.

Question 1: Jacobi's Formula [Done need to type up]

Answer:
Part A: First observe 
$ \textrm{det}(I_N +tA) = 1 +t \textrm{tr}(A) + \textrm{(Higher order t terms)}$

Then differentiating with respect to $t$ at $t=0$

$ \frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0} \textrm{det}(I_N +tA) = 0 +\textrm{tr}(A) + \frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0}\textrm{(Higherorder t terms)}$

The higher order $t$ terms vanish here since we are evaluating at $t=0$. Leaving us with 

$\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0}\textrm{det}(I_n+tA) = \textrm{tr}(A)$

Part B: Observe that 

$\begin{split} \frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0}[\textrm{det}(X+tB)]&=\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=1}[\textrm{det}(X)\textrm{det}(I_n+tX^{-1}B)]\\ & =\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0}\textrm{det}(I_n+tX^{-1}B) \times \textrm{det}(X) + 0 \\ &= \textrm{tr}(X^{-1}B)\times \textrm{det}(X) \end{split} $

Question 2: Hopf Fibrations

Answer: We first show smoothness, which is equivalent to showing that the circle is bijective.

Observe that the group action $\Theta: S^1 \times S^{2n-1} \rightarrow S^{2n-1}$ is given by
$\Theta_z(w) = zw$, so $\Theta_{z^{-1}}(zw) = z^{-1}zw= (z^{-1}zw^i) = w$

Where this multiplication is smooth on each coordinate $w^i$

For $w \in S^{2n-1}$, the orbit $S^1 \cdot w = \{z\cdot w | z\in S^1\}$ should rotate each coordinate by a whole circle

If we then look at the $(2n+1)$ sphere as a subset of $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$, we see that the map 

$F:S^1 (\subset \mathbb{C}) \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^{n+1} $ by $F(z) = (zw^1, \ldots, zw^{n+1})$

This is a linear map and is injective, so then the image is exactly a circle. 

Injectivity then tells us that this map partitions the sphere into disjoint circles, so then the
union of all of these circles should be $S^{2n+1}$

Question 3: Quaternionic Sphere 

Answer:

Part A: Observe that $p*p = (\bar{a},-b)(a,b) = (\bar{a}a +b\bar{b}, ab-ab) = (|a|^2 +|b|^2, 0)$

So $S \subset \mathbb{H}*$, where $S = \{ p \in \mathbb{H} | |p| =1 \}$

So $S$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{H}*$ since for any $p,q \in S$, we get that $|pq| = |p||q| =1$

The fact that $S$ has manifold structure follows from Lee 20.12

Now we want to show that $S \cong SU(2)$

The isomorphism from $SU(2)$ to $S$ follows from the determinant map. Where $det(A) = |p|^2 + |q|^2= aa*$

Where $a=(p,q) \in \mathbb{H}*$

Part B: Let $q=(a,b)\in S$, then $qi = (ai,bi), qj=(-\bar{b},\bar{a}) , qk =(\bar{b}i,-\bar{a}i)$.

Taking the dot product with each other gives 0, hence this is linearly independent and all
three together form a frame for $S$. Left invariance follows from the fact that adding a left shift
corresponds to a left shift in each coordinate in the frame. i.e. $L_x(qi) = (q+x)i = qi +xi $ which
is a frame for $q+x$


Question 4: Abelian Exponentials [Done need to type up]

Question 5: Lee 20-6

Part A:Since $A= e^B$, we can set $C = e^\frac{B}{2}$. Then $C^2 = e^B = A$

Part B: Recall that $A= \begin{pmatrix} \frac{-1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}$ 

If $A \in Gl(n,\mathbb{R})$ was in the image, then there would exist a $C$ such that when squared, is 

$\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} ^2 = \begin{pmatrix} a^2+bc & b(a+d) \\ c(a+d) & bc+d^2 \end{pmatrix} $

But this then forces either $b$ or $c$ is 0 which is a contradiction, or $a =-d$ which is a
contradiction too.

Question 6: Commuting Exponentials 
Answer:

Part A: If $[X,Y] =0$, then as vector fields, $X$ and $Y$ commute with their flows.

Part B: If $G$ is Abelian, then the previous proposition immediately implies that $\frak{g}$ is
Abelian too. Since $exp(tX)exp(sY) \in G$

If $\frak{g}$ commutes, then at any point $p \in G$, if it were to be acted upon by the flow
corresponding to a left shift, $L_q, q\in G$, this corresponds to $p+q$, but by commutivity of the
flows, if we had $q$ acted upon by the left shift $L_p$, we get $q+p$. So then since $[L_q,L_p]=0$
moving by q at p is the same as moving by p at q. Hence, these elements commute.
