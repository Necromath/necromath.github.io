This is for HW 6, Eerily Hot.

Question 1: Jacobi's Formula [Done need to type up]

Answer:
Part A: First observe 
$ \textrm{det}(I_N +tA) = 1 +t \textrm{tr}(A) + \textrm{(Higher order t terms}$

Then differentiating with respect to $t$ at $t=0$

$ \frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0} \textrm{det}(I_N +tA) = 0 +\textrm{tr}(A) + \frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0}\textrm{(Higher order terms}$

The higher order $t$ terms vanish here since we are evaluating at $t=0$. Leaving us with 

$\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0}\textrm{det}(I_n+tA) = \textrm{tr}(A)$

Part B: Observe that 

  a) $\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0} [\textrm{det}(X+tB)] = \frac{d}{dt}|_{t=1}[\textrm{det}(X)\textrm{det}(I_n +t X^{0}B)] $
