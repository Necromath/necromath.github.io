Here is homework 5 questions.

1. What is the correspondence between group representations and modules over the group ring.
2. Let G be a finite group of order n the free \C[G]-Module of rank 1 determines an n-dimensional represntation of G. Called the regular representation of G. Write this rep. down in the form of a homomorphism \rho : G \rightarrow GL(V), where V is a vector space of dimension n.
3. Let S_n denote the symmetric group on n elements and let V be a vector space of dimension n equppied with a basis e_1,...,e_n. 
   	(a) Prove the map \rho : S_ \rightarrow GL(V) given by $$\rho(g)(\Sum _{i=1}^{n}z_i e_i) =(\Sum _{i=1}^{n}z_i e_i)$$
	(b) Show that \rho is injective. When a representation is injective, it is called faithful. What does faithfullness mean in terms of \C[G]-Modules?
	(c) Find a nontrivial, G-invariant subspace of V.
