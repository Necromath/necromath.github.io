Here is where I would put my work for topology...
</p>

<p>
If I had any!! (Dinkleberg to blame)
</p>

<p>
Here are definitions to know: <a href="DefinTop.html">DefinTop</a>
</p>

<p>
Here are some problems I have practiced: <a href="TopPracProb.html">TopPracProb</a>
</p>

<p>
Here are some very important theorems to know the proof of: <a href="ImpTopThm.html">ImpTopThm</a>
</p>

<p>
Some thoughts: A lot of the questions in old prelims see to cover a couple of themes from point set topology. Connectedness, Compactness, Hausdorff, Normal, Metric, Products of spaces, continuous functions. 
</p>

<p>
From algebraic topology: Universal covering space, retraction, homomorphism of fundamental groups.
